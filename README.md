## Gauss Markov fit for the Secondary Representation of the Second

This package will implement a Gauss Markov fit of the frequency values of atomic clocks to derive adjusted frequency values.
This is part of the work of the [CCL-CCTF WGFS](https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cc/cctf/wg/ccl-cctf-wgfs).
